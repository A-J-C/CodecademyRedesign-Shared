CodecademyRedesign-Shared
======================

Contribute to this to improve Codecademy.

The code in this repository are the different  files that make up the [Codecademy Group Redesign](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecademy-group-redesign/bladgjamjaiaffkojoadgeelkgfgkdkp) extension that I have made.

In this repo you can see every file that goes into the extension and contribute new ideas to it.

Push any new files into the **shared** branch and I will merge them up to the master branch.

Thanks,
Alex C
